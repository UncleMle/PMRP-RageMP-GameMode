### How to Install

###### 1. First navigate to ``.env.example`` to enter your mysql database credentials. Enter your MySQL server credentials (The SQL code will be auto generated by Sequelize so as you have pointed it to a database with correct user credentials you will not have to worry about any further setup).
```c#
DB_USERNAME="< enter DB username >"
DB_PASSWORD="< enter DB username >"
DB_NAME="pmrp_db"
DB_HOST="127.0.0.1"
DB_DIALECT="mysql"
```

###### 2. In the same file ``.env.example`` enter your created SMTP email app credentials (You must do this for the OTP authentication system to work and be able to register accounts).

````c#
NODEMAILER_EMAIL="< enter app email >"
NODEMAILER_PASSWORD="< enter app password >"
````

###### 6. You should now be able to run the .exe file and start the gamemode.

# Misc

If your hosting this gamemode from a server external from your local network ensure to port forward so you can connect. [Getting started with server RAGE:MP](https://wiki.rage.mp/index.php?title=Getting_Started_with_Server)

This gamemode also comes with a UCP and discord intergration which can both be ran separately from the main game server.

Discord Intergration: ``packages\discord``

Web Panel: ``pmrp-ucp\client``

To edit the UI you must run the VueJS dev server (located in ``pmrp-frontend\``) once your changes are made simply build the UI with npm run build and drag the contents of ``pmrp-frontend\build`` in the folder ``client_packages\cefs``.
