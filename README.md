### How to Install

###### 1. First navigate to ``packages/config/config.json`` to edit your sequelize configuration. Enter your MySQL server credentials under "development" (The SQL code will be auto generated by Sequelize so as you have pointed it to a database with correct user credentials you will not have to worry about any further setup).
```typescript
{
  "development": {
    "username": "root",
    "password": "%e58s6LodGMl",
    "database": "pmrp_db",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "mysql",
    "logging": false
  },
  "test": {
    "username": "root",
    "password": null,
    "database": "database_test",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "mysql"
  },
  "production": {
    "username": "ragedev",
    "password": "password",
    "database": "ragedev_db",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "mysql",
    "logging": false
  }
}
```

###### 2. Head over to ``packages/CoreSystem/coreApi.js`` and change to your created SMTP email app (You must do this for the OTP authentication system to work and be able to register accounts).

````typescript
const email = ""
const emailPassword = ""
````

###### 3. Acquire the RAGEMP server binary and place it in the root directory.

###### 4. Head to the root directory in your terminal of choice and enter ``npm i`` to install dependencies.

###### 5. You should now be able to run the .exe file and start the gamemode.

# Misc

This gamemode also comes with a UCP and discord intergration which can both be ran separately from the main game server.

Discord Intergration: ``packages\discord``

Web Panel: ``pmrp-ucp\client``

To edit the UI you must run the VueJS dev server (located in ``pmrp-frontend\``) once your changes are made simply build the UI with npm run build and drag the contents of ``pmrp-frontend\build`` in the folder ``client_packages\cefs``.
